Divorce a husband, lose a career … grapple with a murder.
TV journalist Elizabeth “E.M.” Danniher will tell you she committed 
two sins — she didn’t stay young, and she made an enemy of a powerful 
news executive — her ex. She used to break national news. Now her 
top story as the “Helping Out!” reporter at dinky KWMT-TV in Sherman, 
Wyoming is getting a defective toaster repaired.
Tough, funny and determined, Elizabeth wrestles with isolation, 
keeping a professional edge, and an evolving self-image. 
Is Wyoming — the land of cattle, cowboys, tumbleweeds, and fewer 
than six people per square mile — her new home or a road to permanent obscurity?
Soon she’s in a battle of wills with ex-football player turned 
journalist Mike Paycik, who might see her as a handy rung on his career 
ladder or a romantic partner or both. And there’s the matter of a deputy 
sheriff—missing or murdered? Elizabeth finds herself investigating at 
the insistence of a girl who’s set on proving her father’s innocence. 
Not that enigmatic rancher Thomas Burrell makes investigating easy 
for an amateur sleuth.

Cammie Evans was a girl with a plan from the moment God called her to be a foreign missionary. 
After several years spent all over the world, though, she finds 
herself with a new assignment that leaves her questioning all that 
she once thought to be true about life, love, and calling.

David Connor was always the weird kid in the youth group, never 
destined to live up to his father's expectations. After several 
years of working to find his own significance in Christ and his calling 
as a foreign missionary, he finds himself asking hard questions about who 
he is and what God wants from him.
As their lives change and the past becomes part of the present, 
can Cammie and David help one another find their own happily ever after?

 One dark ‘n’ stormy night. One short curvy accountant. One very exclusive club.

Jessica can’t believe her luck. After her car slides into a water-filled ditch, 
she asks to shelter in an isolated mansion only to learns it’s a 
private bondage club. Given the choice, she decides to enter. She hadn’t 
realized when signing the “Rules of the Shadowlands” that she’d get much more 
than she bargained for.              
Her next mistake is attracting the attention of Master Z, the intimidatingly, 
confident owner of the Shadowlands. The most powerful dominant in the club, 
Master Z can have anyone he wants—and he wants Jessica.
It’s time to enter the darkly seductive world of the Shadowlands…
This is not just the best in its genre, I think it might be put in my ultimate 
favorite category. The only problem in reading a book this great is that you tend 
to use it to gauge everything else you read. I may not be able to give out a top 
rating again for awhile. ~ Guilty Indulgence

  After being dumped by her boyfriend and passed over for yet 
  another promotion, Monica Gardner moves to New Orleans, 
  determined to make a name for herself as the new attending 
  ER physician at Methodist Memorial Hospital. As for men--she's 
  through with them. But when given the chance to chair the 
  hospital's annual charity banquet, Monica must elicit 
  the help of gorgeous Ob-gyn Elijah Holmes.

  Eli will do anything to thwart his matchmaking Mama's plan 
  to reunite him with his high school girlfriend. So, when 
  the sexy new ER doc asks for his help in planning this year's 
  charity banquet, Eli devises the perfect scheme: He'll help 
  put on the best banquet the hospital has ever seen, if 
  Monica poses as his new girlfriend. But when Eli finds 
  himself falling in love, he realizes convincing Monica of 
  his true feelings may be his greatest delivery yet.

  <pre>
    On my eighteenth birthday my father, the senator,
    gives me the gift he thinks every little girl dreams of.
    The man of my dreams, and the wedding to match.
    Stefan Zoric is heir to an elite worldwide modeling agency.
    Practically a prince.
    My arrangement is simple, as far as sham marriages go.
    I give him my virginity, behave as the perfect wife and 
    he'll pay for the college degree my father found irrelevant.
    But I don't want to be the perfect wife.
    I want him to want me the way I want him.
    I want him to confide in me.
    But Stefan has secrets that he holds close, 
    dangerous secrets.
    And soon I'm wondering what kind of devil have I made a deal with?
